# Lession-Lab
In this project I use ISIC 2019 dataset for the purpose of different skin lession classification. I use MobileNetV2 for the purpose of solving the problem of classification. I got the validation accuracy of 95% and 99% of training accuracy. In the end of this project I also create a tflite model that can be further use to integrate with flutter.
Some overview of the application that has been designed for this particular task has been followed:
